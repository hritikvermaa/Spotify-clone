# Spotify-clone
Creating a Spotify clone using HTML and CSS is a simplified project aimed at replicating the user interface and design of the Spotify website. While this clone won't have the full functionality of the actual Spotify platform, it serves as a valuable exercise to practice web development skills and gain a deeper understanding of HTML and CSS.
